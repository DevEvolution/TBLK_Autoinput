## Getting started
The program emulates an input to a focused window with specified delays between keystrokes. Before starting the emulation, you need to make sure that the current input language is English. The application can automatically switch languages using the specified combination. To start the input emulation, click on the "Click to go" button and focus on the window into which you want to enter text using the emulation. Also note that the text can use '#' characters for additional delay and '$$$' to stop input.
